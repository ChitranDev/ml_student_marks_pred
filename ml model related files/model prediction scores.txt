1. linear regression model:
	Mean: 6.166982883035766
	Standard deviation: 0.6408011556746425

2. decision tree model:
	Mean:  9.119431212515206
	Standard deviation:  0.8628357091799201	

3. Random Forest Regression:
	Mean:  6.302324509148157
	Standard deviation:  0.6231707629900136



so the linear regression model has the least mean so it is the best algorithm for our model.
