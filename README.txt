This project contains the data files and scripts for scrapping upder 'data_files' folder and other model building and analysis related files under 'ml model related files'

In this project we have used student's periodic marks of each subject (out of 10 given by teacher) and on the basis of that I have tried to predict the percentage of the student.

This project accuracy should be low as this is a generalised model for all classes for 4-9
and we have used subject wise periodic marks and it is very difficult to predict on the basis of periodic marks subject wise that has been assigned by teacher without any prior qualification.

but still the predictions are pretty interesting.
